# italian-memory-game

This repository holds the files for a simple concetnration-style game that renders in the web browser. It teachs simple Italian by matching the tiles with the Italian phrase that correlate to the English translation, which is the corresponding correct answer.

It uses HTML, Javascript, and CSS for the game board.

The game board is generated with random content, when the Start or Reset button is clicked, allowing a new grid to be displayed every time Start or Reset butttons are clicked. 

The game starts with a blank grid. To play, simple navigate to (url), and click Start. When all tiles are face up, you have learned some basic Italian and won the game. Click Reset button to clear the board and play again. 

Currently, I am in the process of fixing the matching logic.
